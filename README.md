# Temp-Assignment
Developing the code in Arduino to interface an LM35 temperature
sensor (Assume the sensor is connected to Arduino Analog pin A0) with an Arduino
Uno and control the onboard LED based on temperature readings:
1. Interfacing the LM35 temperature sensor with an Arduino Uno.
2. When the temperature falls below 30 degrees Celsius, the onboard LED
blink every 250 milliseconds.
3. If the temperature rises above 30 degrees Celsius, the onboard LED blink
every 500 milliseconds.
